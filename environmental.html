						<li>The Amazon Rainforest has many effects, <br>however it impacts our environment the most <br>out of all the other factors.</li><br>
						<li>Deforestation is one of the largest threats to the Amazon Rainforest</li><br>
						<li>Clear cutting is the largest factor in deforestation</li><br>
						<li>Large demand for resources such as beef, sugar, soy, palm oil, and coffee led to a big spike in the Amazon deforestation</li><br>
						<li>Deforestation is common near populated areas, but remote areas are affected too, since they have resources people want</li><br>
